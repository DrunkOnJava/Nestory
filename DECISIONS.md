2. **Automated Enforcement** via:
   - SwiftSyntax-based architecture tests
   - Pre-commit hooks for local verification
   - CI/CD workflows for continuous validation
   - Dev CLI tools for maintenance

3. **Hash-based Integrity** using SPEC.lock to detect unauthorized changes

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Architecture violations caught at commit time
- Self-documenting architectural rules
- Consistent enforcement across team
- Clear boundaries prevent technical debt
- Automated verification reduces review burden

**Negative:**
- Additional build step overhead

#### Project Structure Improvements:

**Before Cleanup:**
- 6 backup directories (Services.backup/, Features.backup/, App-Main.backup/, Foundation/Models.backup/)
- 4 loose .backup files scattered in build output
- Total: 11 backup items creating project clutter

**After Cleanup:**
- 1 organized Archive/ directory with 4 categorized subdirectories
- All backup directories removed from main project structure
- Clear separation: Active (integrated), Future (archived), Deleted (redundant)

#### Enhanced Functionality:

The integrated services provide significant enhancements:
1. **AnalyticsService**: Currency conversion, depreciation tracking, trend analysis, performance monitoring
2. **CurrencyService**: Offline-first multi-currency support with 20+ currencies
3. **InventoryService**: Proper service layer with caching, bulk operations, search
4. **Receipt/Warranty Models**: Support for enhanced documentation features

#### Archive Organization:

```
Archive/
├── Future-Features/     # Phase G+ implementations
├── Models/             # Extended model library
├── Services/           # Future cloud services
└── TCA-Migration/      # Future architecture migration
```

All archived code is well-organized, documented, and ready for future integration when needed.

**Result**: Project structure significantly cleaner while preserving all valuable code and enhancing current functionality.
