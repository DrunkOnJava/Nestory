# Nestory Build Instructions

## ✅ Concurrency Fix Applied

The Swift 6 concurrency warning has been fixed by adding `@MainActor` to `ThemeManager`.

## 🏃 Quick Run Instructions

### Option 1: Command Line Build & Run
```bash
cd /Users/griffin/Projects/Nestory
chmod +x run_app_final.sh
./run_app_final.sh
```

### Option 2: Open in Xcode
```bash
cd /Users/griffin/Projects/Nestory

# Generate project if needed
xcodegen generate

# Open in Xcode
open Nestory.xcodeproj
```

In Xcode:
1. Select **Nestory-Dev** scheme (top left)
2. Select **iPhone 15** simulator
3. Press **Cmd+R** to run

## 📱 What You'll See

A working iOS app with:
- **Inventory List**: Shows your items
- **Add Button**: Tap + to add new items
- **SwiftData Persistence**: Items are saved
- **Dark Mode**: Automatic theme support

## 🔧 If You See Warnings

The "lstat" warnings about `.abi.json`, `.swiftdoc` etc. are **normal** - they're just Xcode looking for incremental build files that don't exist yet. They'll disappear after the first successful build.

## ✨ Current Features

The app currently includes:
- Basic Item model with SwiftData
- ContentView with list display
- ThemeManager for dark/light mode
- Add item functionality
- Empty state when no items

## 🎯 Build Status

✅ **ThemeManager.swift** - Fixed (added @MainActor)
✅ **Item.swift** - Simplified model working
✅ **ContentView.swift** - Basic list view working
✅ **NestoryApp.swift** - App entry point working

## 📝 Notes

This is a **minimal working version** to establish a solid foundation. Once this builds and runs successfully, we can incrementally add:
- The Composable Architecture (TCA)
- Complex models (Category, Location, etc.)
- Full inventory features
- Services layer
