nestory_build_success{branch, runner, workflow}
nestory_workflow_runs_total{workflow, status}
```

#### Performance Metrics:
```prometheus
nestory_cold_start_seconds{date}
nestory_memory_usage_mb{date}
nestory_build_time_seconds{type, date}
```

#### Quality Metrics:
```prometheus
nestory_lint_issues_total{branch}
nestory_format_issues_total{branch}
nestory_quality_check_success{branch}
```

### Grafana Dashboard Integration

## Performance Enhancements

### Build Time Optimization
1. **3-Tier Caching Strategy**:
   - Level 1: SPM packages (shared across builds)

## Usage Guidelines

### Triggering Workflows
```bash
# Main CI pipeline
git push origin main  # Auto-triggers ios-continuous.yml

# Manual device testing
gh workflow run device-testing.yml --field device_name="iPhone 15 Pro"

# Cache management
gh workflow run build-cache-config.yml --field action=warm

# Performance testing
gh workflow run nightly-performance.yml --field performance_suite=comprehensive
```

### Monitoring Access
- **Grafana Dashboard**: http://192.168.1.5:3000
- **Prometheus Metrics**: http://192.168.1.5:9090
- **Build Logs**: GitHub Actions interface

### Best Practices
1. **Use ios-continuous.yml** as primary CI pipeline
2. **Schedule device testing** for release branches
3. **Monitor performance trends** in Grafana
4. **Investigate regressions** when alerts trigger
5. **Leverage cache warming** during off-peak hours

## Architecture Compliance

All workflows maintain strict adherence to:
- **iPhone 16 Pro Max** as primary test target
- **TCA architecture** requirements
- **Insurance documentation focus** (no business inventory references)
- **Service wiring verification**
- **File size guardrails**

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor Initial Performance**: Track cache effectiveness and build times
2. **Tune Thresholds**: Adjust regression detection based on baseline data
3. **Expand Device Testing**: Add more device configurations as needed
4. **Alert Configuration**: Set up Slack/email notifications for regressions
5. **Dashboard Enhancement**: Add more detailed performance visualizations
