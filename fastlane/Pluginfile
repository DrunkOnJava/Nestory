# Only include plugins that actually exist in the Fastlane ecosystem

# Basic functionality - using built-in fastlane actions instead of plugins where possible
# Most functionality we need is already built into fastlane core

# Essential plugins that actually exist
gem 'fastlane-plugin-badge'            # Add badges to app icons (real plugin)
gem 'fastlane-plugin-increment_version_code' # Version management (real plugin)

# Note: Most of the plugins in the original Pluginfile don't exist
# We're using minimal plugins and relying on built-in fastlane actions instead
