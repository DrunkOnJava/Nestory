**Most Critical Remaining Items:**
1. **PR #16**: Matrix build strategy (significant CI/CD enhancement)
2. **Issue #15**: CloudKit configuration (critical data feature)  
3. **Issues #8/#10**: UI/UX improvements (user experience)

The repository is now better organized with clear priorities and reduced administrative backlog.
