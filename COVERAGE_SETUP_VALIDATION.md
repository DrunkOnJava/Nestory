- **Retention**: Manual cleanup via `make coverage-clean`

### Coverage Report Generation
- **Summary**: Text format with coverage percentages
- **Detailed**: JSON format with line-by-line coverage
- **HTML**: Visual report with styling and navigation
- **File List**: Per-file coverage breakdown
- **Percentage**: Extracted for CI/dashboard integration

### Performance Metrics Collection
- **XCTestMetrics**: Automatic collection during test execution
- **OSSignpost**: Manual instrumentation for custom performance tracking
- **Result Bundle**: Persistent storage for historical analysis
- **Xcode Integration**: Direct viewing in Test and Insights tabs

## 📊 EXPECTED TAB BEHAVIOR

### Coverage Tab
**Will Display**:
- Overall project coverage percentage
- File-by-file coverage breakdown
- Line-by-line coverage visualization
- Uncovered code highlighting
- Historical coverage trends

**Data Source**: `.xcresult` bundle with `codeCoverageEnabled="YES"`

### Test Tab
**Will Display**:
- Test execution results and status
- Performance metrics from XCTestMetrics
- Test timing and duration analysis

## 🚀 USAGE INSTRUCTIONS

### Quick Start
```bash
# Run tests with full coverage and insights
make test-with-coverage

# Run tests and automatically open results in Xcode
make test-with-coverage-open

# Extract coverage from most recent test run
make extract-coverage-open
```

### Advanced Usage
```bash
# Direct script execution
./Scripts/CLI/test-with-insights.sh --open-results

# Standalone coverage extraction  
./Scripts/CLI/extract-coverage.sh [result-bundle] [output-dir]

# Clean up artifacts
make coverage-clean
```

### Xcode Integration
1. Run tests via Makefile or CLI scripts
2. Open generated `.xcresult` bundle in Xcode
3. Navigate to Coverage, Test, and Insights tabs
4. Analyze rich data visualizations and metrics

## ⚡ PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION

### Build Performance
- Temporary DerivedData per test run
- Parallel test execution disabled for consistency
- Optimized simulator targeting (iPhone 16 Pro Max)
- Timeout protection for hung processes

### Data Efficiency  
- Timestamped artifacts prevent conflicts
- Selective coverage report generation
- On-demand HTML report creation
- Configurable result bundle retention

## 🔍 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Common Issues
1. **Empty Coverage Tab**: Ensure `codeCoverageEnabled="YES"` in scheme
2. **Missing Test Metrics**: Verify `enablePerformanceTestMetrics="YES"`
3. **No Insights Data**: Check os_signpost usage in code
4. **Script Permissions**: Run `chmod +x Scripts/CLI/*.sh`

### Validation Commands
```bash
# Verify scheme configuration
cat Nestory.xcodeproj/xcshareddata/xcschemes/Nestory-Dev.xcscheme | grep -E "(codeCoverage|Performance|Metrics)"

# Check script permissions
ls -la Scripts/CLI/*.sh

# Validate Makefile targets
make test-with-coverage --dry-run
```
