# Nestory Architecture Visualization Report
Generated: August 21, 2025

## üìä Project Overview

**Nestory** is a personal home inventory app built with **The Composable Architecture (TCA)** using a **6-layer architecture** pattern:

```
App ‚Üí Features ‚Üí UI ‚Üí Services ‚Üí Infrastructure ‚Üí Foundation
```

### Layer Distribution
- **App-Main**: 91 Swift files (Views and app coordination)
- **Services**: 106 Swift files (Business logic and data access)
- **Infrastructure**: 38 Swift files (Technical adapters)
- **Foundation**: 38 Swift files (Core models and types)
- **UI**: 17 Swift files (Shared SwiftUI components)
- **Features**: 10 Swift files (TCA Reducers and state management)

**Total**: 300 primary Swift files (2,991 including dependencies)

## üß© TCA Architecture Analysis

### Core TCA Components
- **Reducers**: 12 total (3 in Features layer ‚úÖ)
- **ObservableState structs**: 11
- **Dependencies**: 72 total (28 analyzed)
- **Action Cases**: 118 across all features

### Feature Modules
1. **Analytics** - Business insights and reporting
2. **Inventory** - Core item management with CRUD operations
3. **Search** - Advanced search and filtering capabilities
4. **Settings** - Configuration and preferences

### Most Used Services
1. `inventoryService.inventoryService`: 7 usages
2. `notificationService.notificationService`: 6 usages  
3. `insuranceClaimService.claimService`: 3 usages
4. `importExportService.importExportService`: 2 usages
5. `insuranceReportService.insuranceReportService`: 2 usages

## üîå Service Integration Analysis

### Services Available (Top 20)
- AnalyticsService
- AppStoreConnectOrchestrator
- BarcodeScannerService
- ClaimExportService
- ClaimPackageAssemblerService
- CloudBackupService
- DamageAssessmentService
- ImportExportService
- InsuranceClaimService
- InsuranceReportService
- InventoryService
- NotificationService
- ReceiptOCRService
- WarrantyTrackingService
- And 72 more...

### Service Wiring Status
- **Views using services**: 14 out of 91 App-Main views
- **Dependency injection**: ‚úÖ Properly implemented with TCA `@Dependency`
- **Service accessibility**: Services are wired but could have broader UI integration

## üö® Architecture Compliance Report

### ‚úÖ Compliant Areas
- **TCA Reducers properly in Features layer**
- **No Features ‚Üí Infrastructure violations**
- **Dependency injection working correctly**
- **Layer separation mostly maintained**

### ‚ùå Violations Found
1. **UI ‚Üí Services violation**: 1 file
   - `UI/Components/ExportOptionsView.swift` imports Services
2. **Business inventory references**: 17 files contain inappropriate stock-related terms
   - Should focus on insurance documentation, not business inventory

### üéØ Architecture Score: **85/100**
- Deduction: UI layer violation (-10)
- Deduction: Business inventory terminology (-5)

## üìà Dependency Graph Insights

### Swift Package Dependencies
- **swift-syntax**: Version 509.0.0 (for code generation)
- **Total external dependencies**: Minimal (following best practices)

### Internal Dependencies
Most connected services form the core business logic:
- **InventoryService**: Central hub for all item management
- **NotificationService**: Cross-cutting concern for user alerts
- **InsuranceClaimService**: Critical for the app's primary purpose

## üîß Visualization Tools Setup

### Generated Analysis Tools
1. **`analyze_architecture.sh`** - Shell script for compliance checking
2. **`tca_analysis.py`** - Python script for TCA-specific analysis
3. **`dependencies.dot/.png`** - Swift Package Manager dependency graph

### Available Commands
```bash
# Architecture analysis
./analyze_architecture.sh

# TCA analysis
python3 tca_analysis.py

# Dependency visualization
open dependencies.png

# Project verification
make check
make verify-arch
make verify-wiring
```

## üí° Recommendations

### Immediate Fixes
1. **Fix UI ‚Üí Services violation**:
   ```swift
   // In UI/Components/ExportOptionsView.swift
   // Remove: import Services
   // Use: Pass data via parameters instead
   ```

2. **Replace business inventory terms**:
   - Replace "stock" with "documentation status"
   - Replace "inventory level" with "documentation completeness"
   - Focus on insurance claim preparation context

### Architecture Improvements
1. **Expand service wiring**: Only 14/91 App-Main views use services
2. **Add more TCA Features**: Consider migrating more views to TCA pattern
3. **Service consolidation**: 106 service files might benefit from grouping

### Performance Optimizations
1. **Lazy loading**: Implement for large item collections
2. **Batch operations**: Already implemented in database layer
3. **Memory management**: Consider caching strategies for frequently accessed data

## üéì Architecture Strengths

### Excellent Design Patterns
- **Protocol-first services** enable easy testing and mocking
- **TCA state management** provides predictable, debuggable data flow
- **6-layer architecture** maintains clear separation of concerns
- **Dependency injection** makes the codebase modular and testable

### Scalability Indicators
- **Modular service design** allows for easy feature additions
- **Clear layer boundaries** enable parallel development
- **Comprehensive testing infrastructure** supports confident refactoring

## üöÄ Next Steps

### Development Workflow
1. Run `./analyze_architecture.sh` before major changes
2. Use `make verify-arch` in CI/CD pipeline
3. Monitor service usage with `python3 tca_analysis.py`
4. Update this report monthly or after major architectural changes

### Tooling Enhancements
Consider adding these tools in the future:
- **SwiftLint architectural rules** for automated layer boundary checking
- **Dependency graph automation** in build process
- **Service usage metrics** in analytics dashboard
