## Gap Analysis: What's Missing from Consolidated Dashboard

### From Build Errors & Analysis:
- ❌ **Build Warnings tracking**
- ❌ **Lines of Code metrics**
- ❌ **Error Distribution Heatmap**
- ❌ **Error Types Distribution**
- ❌ **Build Performance by Scheme** (detailed)
- ❌ **Recent Build Errors table**
- ❌ **Build Error Logs**

### From Complete Monitoring Platform:
- ❌ **Builds Today counter**
- ❌ **Test Coverage percentage**
- ❌ **Executive Overview section**

### From Actionable CI/CD Monitoring:
- ❌ **P95 Build Time** (we only have latest)
- ❌ **Stuck Builds detection**
- ❌ **Queue Length monitoring**
- ❌ **"ARE WE ON FIRE?" status header**

## Recommendation

**❌ DO NOT DELETE OTHER DASHBOARDS YET**

The consolidated dashboard is missing several important features:
1. **Warning tracking** (critical for code quality)
2. **Heatmaps and distributions** (important for error analysis)
3. **P95 metrics** (better than latest for performance monitoring)
4. **Build logs integration** (essential for debugging)
5. **Queue monitoring** (important for CI/CD health)

## Next Steps

1. **Enhance the consolidated dashboard** to include missing features
2. **Test all metrics work correctly** with real data
3. **Then delete redundant dashboards** once consolidation is complete
