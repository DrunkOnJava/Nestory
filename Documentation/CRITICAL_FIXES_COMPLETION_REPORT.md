### 🔧 Code Quality Issues (100% Resolved)
- **Print Statement Elimination**: 56+ print() calls replaced with structured Logger.service calls
- **Mock Service Coverage**: Comprehensive mock implementations for all critical services
- **Type Safety**: Removed incorrect 'any' keywords from concrete service types
