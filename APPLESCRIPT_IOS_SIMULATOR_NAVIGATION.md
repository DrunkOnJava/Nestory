## Overview

AppleScript can be used to automate iOS Simulator interactions for testing, documentation, and UI exploration. While XCUIAutomation is the preferred method for formal testing, AppleScript provides a valuable alternative for manual exploration and screenshot capture.

### When to Use AppleScript vs XCUIAutomation

**Use AppleScript for:**
- Quick manual exploration of app UIs
- Screenshot capture workflows
- Ad-hoc testing scenarios
- Automating repetitive manual tasks
- Integration with non-Xcode workflows

**Use XCUIAutomation for:**
- Formal automated testing
- CI/CD integration
- Comprehensive test suites
- Accessibility validation
- Performance testing

---

## Prerequisites

### Required Software
- macOS with iOS Simulator
- Xcode (for iOS Simulator)
- AppleScript Editor (built into macOS)
- Target iOS app installed in simulator

### Accessibility Setup
1. **Enable Accessibility Inspector** (Optional but helpful):
   ```
   Xcode → Open Developer Tool → Accessibility Inspector
   ```

2. **Simulator Accessibility** (if needed):
   - iOS Simulator → Settings → Accessibility → enable features as needed

### Basic AppleScript Knowledge
Ensure familiarity with:
- AppleScript syntax
- `tell` blocks
- Error handling (`try`/`on error`)
- Variables and loops

---

## Core Concepts

### Application Targeting

#### Simulator Process
```applescript
tell application "Simulator"
    activate  -- Brings Simulator to front
end tell

tell application "System Events"
    tell process "Simulator"
        -- All UI interactions go here
    end tell
end tell
```

#### Multiple Simulators
```applescript
-- Get list of all running simulators
tell application "System Events"
    set simulatorProcesses to every process whose name contains "Simulator"
    repeat with currentSim in simulatorProcesses
        tell currentSim
            -- Interact with specific simulator instance
        end tell
    end repeat
end tell
```

### UI Element Hierarchy

Understanding the iOS Simulator's UI hierarchy is crucial:

```
Simulator Application
└── Window 1 (Simulator Window)
    └── Group 1 (Device Screen Container)
        └── Group 1 (App Content Area)
            ├── Navigation Bars
            ├── Tab Bars  
            ├── Buttons
            ├── Text Fields
            ├── Tables
            └── Other UI Elements
```

---

## Basic Navigation Patterns

### Activating the Simulator

```applescript
-- Basic activation
tell application "Simulator" to activate

-- Wait for activation
tell application "Simulator"
    activate
    delay 1  -- Give time for window to come to front
end tell
```

### Finding and Clicking Buttons

#### By Accessibility Label
```applescript
tell application "System Events"
    tell process "Simulator"
        try
            -- Find button by name/label
            set targetButton to button "Settings" of group 1 of group 1 of window 1
            if exists targetButton then
                click targetButton
                delay 2  -- Wait for navigation
            end if
        on error errMsg
            log "Button not found: " & errMsg
        end try
    end tell
end tell
```

#### By Index Position
```applescript
tell application "System Events"
    tell process "Simulator"
        try
            -- Click the 5th button (index 4, zero-based)
            set allButtons to every button of group 1 of group 1 of window 1
            if (count of allButtons) >= 5 then
                click item 5 of allButtons
                delay 2
            end if
        on error errMsg
            log "Index-based click failed: " & errMsg
        end try
    end tell
end tell
```

### Tab Bar Navigation

```applescript
-- Navigate through tab bar tabs
tell application "System Events"
    tell process "Simulator"
        try
            -- Common tab navigation pattern
            set tabNames to {"Inventory", "Search", "Analytics", "Categories", "Settings"}
            
            repeat with tabName in tabNames
                try
                    set tabButton to button tabName of group 1 of group 1 of window 1
                    if exists tabButton then
                        log "Clicking " & tabName & " tab"
                        click tabButton
                        delay 3  -- Wait for transition
                    end if
                on error
                    log "Tab " & tabName & " not found"
                end try
            end repeat
        on error errMsg
            log "Tab navigation failed: " & errMsg
        end try
    end tell
end tell
```

### Text Input

```applescript
tell application "System Events"
    tell process "Simulator"
        try
            -- Find and interact with text field
            set usernameField to text field 1 of group 1 of group 1 of window 1
            if exists usernameField then
                click usernameField
                delay 1
                keystroke "user@example.com"
                delay 1
                
                -- Move to next field (Tab key)
                key code 48  -- Tab key
                delay 1
                keystroke "password123"
            end if
        on error errMsg
            log "Text input failed: " & errMsg
        end try
    end tell
end tell
```

## Advanced Techniques

### Dynamic Element Discovery

```applescript
-- Explore UI hierarchy dynamically
tell application "System Events"
    tell process "Simulator"
        try
            -- Get all UI elements in main container
            set mainGroup to group 1 of group 1 of window 1
            
            -- Find all buttons
            set allButtons to every button of mainGroup
            log "Found " & (count of allButtons) & " buttons"
            
            repeat with currentButton in allButtons
                try
                    set buttonName to name of currentButton
                    set buttonTitle to title of currentButton
                    log "Button: " & buttonName & " (Title: " & buttonTitle & ")"
                on error
                    -- Button might not have accessible name/title
                    log "Button found but no accessible name"
                end try
            end repeat
            
            -- Find all text fields
            set allTextFields to every text field of mainGroup
            log "Found " & (count of allTextFields) & " text fields"
            
            -- Find all tables
            set allTables to every table of mainGroup
            log "Found " & (count of allTables) & " tables"
            
        on error errMsg
            log "UI exploration failed: " & errMsg
        end try
    end tell
end tell
```

### Nested Element Navigation

```applescript
-- Navigate through nested UI structures
tell application "System Events"
    tell process "Simulator"
        try
            -- Navigate to Settings → Import/Export section
            
            -- 1. Click Settings tab
            click button "Settings" of group 1 of group 1 of window 1
            delay 2
            
            -- 2. Look for scrollable area
            set scrollArea to scroll area 1 of group 1 of group 1 of window 1
            if exists scrollArea then
                -- 3. Find buttons within scroll area
                set scrollButtons to every button of scrollArea
                
                repeat with currentButton in scrollButtons
                    try
                        set buttonLabel to name of currentButton
                        if buttonLabel contains "Export" or buttonLabel contains "Import" then
                            log "Found export/import button: " & buttonLabel
                            click currentButton
                            delay 2
                            exit repeat
                        end if
                    on error
                        -- Skip buttons without names
                    end try
                end repeat
            end if
            
        on error errMsg
            log "Nested navigation failed: " & errMsg
        end try
    end tell
end tell
```

### Gesture Simulation

```applescript
-- Simulate swipe gestures using mouse events
tell application "System Events"
    tell process "Simulator"
        try
            -- Get the main app area
            set appArea to group 1 of group 1 of window 1
            set appPosition to position of appArea
            set appSize to size of appArea
            
            -- Calculate center point
            set centerX to (item 1 of appPosition) + ((item 1 of appSize) / 2)
            set centerY to (item 2 of appPosition) + ((item 2 of appSize) / 2)
            
            -- Simulate swipe up (scroll down)
            set startY to centerY + 100
            set endY to centerY - 100
            
            -- Mouse down at start position
            set mouseLoc to {centerX, startY}
            
            -- This approach requires more complex mouse event simulation
            -- Note: Direct mouse dragging in AppleScript has limitations
            
        on error errMsg
            log "Gesture simulation failed: " & errMsg
        end try
    end tell
end tell
```

## Coordinate-Based Interaction

### Finding Element Coordinates

```applescript
-- Get position and size of elements for coordinate-based interaction
tell application "System Events"
    tell process "Simulator"
        try
            -- Get the main app area
            set appArea to group 1 of group 1 of window 1
            set appPosition to position of appArea
            set appSize to size of appArea
            
            log "App area position: " & (item 1 of appPosition) & ", " & (item 2 of appPosition)
            log "App area size: " & (item 1 of appSize) & " x " & (item 2 of appSize)
            
            -- Calculate common interaction points
            set leftEdge to item 1 of appPosition
            set topEdge to item 2 of appPosition
            set rightEdge to leftEdge + (item 1 of appSize)
            set bottomEdge to topEdge + (item 2 of appSize)
            set centerX to leftEdge + ((item 1 of appSize) / 2)
            set centerY to topEdge + ((item 2 of appSize) / 2)
            
            -- Tab bar is typically at the bottom
            set tabBarY to bottomEdge - 80  -- Approximate tab bar height
            
            -- Calculate tab positions (assuming 5 tabs)
            set tabWidth to (item 1 of appSize) / 5
            set tab1X to leftEdge + (tabWidth * 0.5)  -- Inventory
            set tab2X to leftEdge + (tabWidth * 1.5)  -- Search
            set tab3X to leftEdge + (tabWidth * 2.5)  -- Analytics
            set tab4X to leftEdge + (tabWidth * 3.5)  -- Categories
            set tab5X to leftEdge + (tabWidth * 4.5)  -- Settings
            
            log "Tab positions at Y=" & tabBarY & ":"
            log "  Tab 1 (Inventory): " & tab1X
            log "  Tab 2 (Search): " & tab2X
            log "  Tab 3 (Analytics): " & tab3X
            log "  Tab 4 (Categories): " & tab4X
            log "  Tab 5 (Settings): " & tab5X
            
            return {tabBarY, tab1X, tab2X, tab3X, tab4X, tab5X}
            
        on error errMsg
            log "Coordinate calculation failed: " & errMsg
            return {}
        end try
    end tell
end tell
```

### Precise Coordinate Clicking

```applescript
-- Click at specific coordinates
on clickAtCoordinates(x, y)
    tell application "System Events"
        tell process "Simulator"
            try
                log "Clicking at coordinates: " & x & ", " & y
                click at {x, y}
                delay 1
                return true
            on error errMsg
                log "Coordinate click failed: " & errMsg
                return false
            end try
        end tell
    end tell
end clickAtCoordinates

-- Example usage: Navigate to Settings tab
set coordinates to {} -- Get from coordinate calculation above
if length of coordinates > 0 then
    set tabBarY to item 1 of coordinates
    set settingsX to item 6 of coordinates
    clickAtCoordinates(settingsX, tabBarY)
end if
```

## Screenshot Integration

### Basic Screenshot Capture

```applescript
-- Capture screenshot using xcrun simctl
on captureScreenshot(filename)
    try
        set screenshotPath to (path to desktop as text) & filename & ".png"
        set unixPath to POSIX path of screenshotPath
        
        do shell script "xcrun simctl io booted screenshot " & quoted form of unixPath
        
        log "Screenshot saved: " & screenshotPath
        return screenshotPath
        
    on error errMsg
        log "Screenshot capture failed: " & errMsg
        return ""
    end try
end captureScreenshot
```

### Screenshot Workflow Integration

```applescript
-- Complete navigation and screenshot workflow
on navigateAndCapture()
    tell application "Simulator" to activate
    delay 2
    
    set tabNames to {"Inventory", "Search", "Analytics", "Categories", "Settings"}
    set screenshotCount to 1
    
    -- Capture initial state
    set screenshotName to (screenshotCount as string) & "_Initial"
    captureScreenshot(screenshotName)
    set screenshotCount to screenshotCount + 1
    
    tell application "System Events"
        tell process "Simulator"
            -- Navigate through each tab
            repeat with tabName in tabNames
                try
                    -- Try to find and click tab
                    set tabButton to button tabName of group 1 of group 1 of window 1
                    if exists tabButton then
                        log "Navigating to " & tabName
                        click tabButton
                        delay 3  -- Wait for transition
                        
                        -- Capture screenshot
                        set screenshotName to (screenshotCount as string) & "_" & tabName
                        captureScreenshot(screenshotName)
                        set screenshotCount to screenshotCount + 1
                    else
                        log "Tab " & tabName & " not found"
                    end if
                on error errMsg
                    log "Failed to navigate to " & tabName & ": " & errMsg
                end try
            end repeat
        end tell
    end tell
    
    log "Navigation and screenshot capture complete"
end navigateAndCapture
```

## Error Handling

### Comprehensive Error Handling Pattern

```applescript
-- Robust error handling template
on robustNavigation()
    set maxRetries to 3
    set currentRetry to 0
    
    tell application "Simulator"
        activate
        delay 2
    end tell
    
    repeat while currentRetry < maxRetries
        tell application "System Events"
            tell process "Simulator"
                try
                    -- Attempt navigation
                    set targetButton to button "Settings" of group 1 of group 1 of window 1
                    
                    -- Verify element exists and is accessible
                    if exists targetButton then
                        if enabled of targetButton then
                            click targetButton
                            delay 2
                            
                            -- Verify navigation succeeded
                            if exists static text "Settings" of group 1 of group 1 of window 1 then
                                log "Navigation successful"
                                return true
                            else
                                log "Navigation appeared to fail - no Settings title found"
                                set currentRetry to currentRetry + 1
                            end if
                        else
                            log "Button exists but is not enabled"
                            set currentRetry to currentRetry + 1
                        end if
                    else
                        log "Button does not exist"
                        set currentRetry to currentRetry + 1
                    end if
                    
                on error errMsg
                    log "Navigation attempt " & (currentRetry + 1) & " failed: " & errMsg
                    set currentRetry to currentRetry + 1
                    
                    -- Wait before retry
                    if currentRetry < maxRetries then
                        delay 5
                    end if
                end try
            end tell
        end tell
    end repeat
    
    log "Navigation failed after " & maxRetries & " attempts"
    return false
end robustNavigation
```

### Fallback Strategies

```applescript
-- Multiple navigation strategies with fallbacks
on navigateToSettingsWithFallbacks()
    tell application "System Events"
        tell process "Simulator"
            -- Strategy 1: Find by button name
            try
                set settingsButton to button "Settings" of group 1 of group 1 of window 1
                if exists settingsButton then
                    click settingsButton
                    delay 2
                    return "Success: Name-based navigation"
                end if
            on error
                log "Strategy 1 failed: Name-based navigation"
            end try
            
            -- Strategy 2: Find by tab position (rightmost)
            try
                set allButtons to every button of group 1 of group 1 of window 1
                if (count of allButtons) >= 5 then
                    click item 5 of allButtons  -- Assuming Settings is 5th tab
                    delay 2
                    return "Success: Position-based navigation"
                end if
            on error
                log "Strategy 2 failed: Position-based navigation"
            end try
            
            -- Strategy 3: Coordinate-based clicking
            try
                -- Get app area for coordinate calculation
                set appArea to group 1 of group 1 of window 1
                set appPosition to position of appArea
                set appSize to size of appArea
                
                -- Calculate Settings tab position (rightmost)
                set settingsX to (item 1 of appPosition) + (item 1 of appSize) * 0.9
                set settingsY to (item 2 of appPosition) + (item 2 of appSize) * 0.95
                
                click at {settingsX, settingsY}
                delay 2
                return "Success: Coordinate-based navigation"
                
            on error
                log "Strategy 3 failed: Coordinate-based navigation"
            end try
            
            -- Strategy 4: Exhaustive button search
            try
                set allButtons to every button of group 1 of group 1 of window 1
                repeat with currentButton in allButtons
                    try
                        set buttonText to name of currentButton
                        if buttonText contains "Settings" or buttonText contains "settings" then
                            click currentButton
                            delay 2
                            return "Success: Exhaustive search navigation"
                        end if
                    on error
                        -- Skip buttons without accessible names
                    end try
                end repeat
            on error
                log "Strategy 4 failed: Exhaustive search"
            end try
            
        end tell
    end tell
    
    return "All navigation strategies failed"
end navigateToSettingsWithFallbacks
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Timing and Delays

```applescript
-- Use appropriate delays for UI transitions
on smartDelay(actionType)
    if actionType is "tap" then
        delay 1  -- Short delay for simple taps
    else if actionType is "navigation" then
        delay 2  -- Medium delay for tab/screen changes
    else if actionType is "loading" then
        delay 5  -- Longer delay for data loading
    else if actionType is "animation" then
        delay 3  -- Wait for animations to complete
    else
        delay 1  -- Default
    end if
end smartDelay

-- Usage
click button "Settings"
smartDelay("navigation")
```

### 2. Element Validation

```applescript
-- Always validate elements before interaction
on safeElementClick(elementPath, elementDescription)
    tell application "System Events"
        tell process "Simulator"
            try
                if exists elementPath then
                    if enabled of elementPath then
                        log "Clicking " & elementDescription
                        click elementPath
                        return true
                    else
                        log elementDescription & " exists but is disabled"
                        return false
                    end if
                else
                    log elementDescription & " does not exist"
                    return false
                end if
            on error errMsg
                log "Failed to click " & elementDescription & ": " & errMsg
                return false
            end try
        end tell
    end tell
end safeElementClick
```

### 3. State Management

```applescript
-- Track application state during navigation
property appState : {currentTab:"Unknown", navigationStack:{}}

on updateAppState(newTab, action)
    set currentTab of appState to newTab
    set end of navigationStack of appState to action
    log "App state: " & newTab & " | Stack: " & (count of navigationStack of appState)
end updateAppState

on resetAppState()
    set currentTab of appState to "Unknown"
    set navigationStack of appState to {}
    log "App state reset"
end resetAppState
```

### 4. Logging and Documentation

```applescript
-- Comprehensive logging for debugging
on logAction(actionType, elementName, result, additionalInfo)
    set timestamp to (current date) as string
    set logEntry to "[" & timestamp & "] " & actionType & " '" & elementName & "' - " & result
    
    if additionalInfo is not "" then
        set logEntry to logEntry & " | " & additionalInfo
    end if
    
    log logEntry
    
    -- Optionally write to file for persistent logging
    writeToLogFile(logEntry)
end logAction

on writeToLogFile(logEntry)
    try
        set logFile to (path to desktop as text) & "AppleScript_iOS_Navigation.log"
        set fileRef to open for access file logFile with write permission
        write (logEntry & return) to fileRef starting at eof
        close access fileRef
    on error
        -- Fail silently if logging to file fails
        close access fileRef
    end try
end writeToLogFile
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### 1. Element Not Found

**Problem**: `Can't get button "Settings" of process "Simulator"`

**Solutions**:
```applescript
-- Use more specific path
set settingsButton to button "Settings" of group 1 of group 1 of window 1

-- Use alternative element queries
set allButtons to every button
repeat with btn in allButtons
    if name of btn contains "Settings" then
        -- Found it
    end if
end repeat

-- Use element existence checking
if exists button "Settings" then
    click button "Settings"
end if
```

#### 2. Timing Issues

**Problem**: Element exists but interaction fails

**Solutions**:
```applescript
-- Add delays
delay 2

-- Wait for element to become enabled
repeat 10 times
    if exists button "Settings" and enabled of button "Settings" then
        exit repeat
    end if
    delay 0.5
end repeat

-- Verify element state before interaction
if exists targetElement and enabled of targetElement then
    click targetElement
end if
```

#### 3. Simulator Window Focus

**Problem**: Actions don't register because Simulator isn't active

**Solutions**:
```applescript
-- Ensure Simulator is active
tell application "Simulator"
    activate
    delay 1
end tell

-- Verify window exists
tell application "System Events"
    tell process "Simulator"
        if not (exists window 1) then
            error "Simulator window not found"
        end if
    end tell
end tell
```

#### 4. UI Hierarchy Changes

**Problem**: Element paths break when app UI changes

**Solutions**:
```applescript
-- Use flexible element discovery
on findElementByName(elementType, elementName)
    tell application "System Events"
        tell process "Simulator"
            try
                -- Search in main container
                set mainArea to group 1 of group 1 of window 1
                
                if elementType is "button" then
                    set elements to every button of mainArea
                else if elementType is "text field" then
                    set elements to every text field of mainArea
                else
                    set elements to every UI element of mainArea
                end if
                
                repeat with elem in elements
                    try
                        if name of elem is elementName then
                            return elem
                        end if
                    end try
                end repeat
                
                return missing value
                
            on error
                return missing value
            end try
        end tell
    end tell
end findElementByName
```

## Performance Optimization

### Efficient Element Caching

```applescript
-- Cache frequently used elements
property elementCache : {}

on getElement(elementType, elementName)
    set cacheKey to elementType & ":" & elementName
    
    -- Check cache first
    repeat with cacheEntry in elementCache
        if item 1 of cacheEntry is cacheKey then
            return item 2 of cacheEntry
        end if
    end repeat
    
    -- Element not in cache, find it
    tell application "System Events"
        tell process "Simulator"
            try
                if elementType is "button" then
                    set foundElement to button elementName of group 1 of group 1 of window 1
                else if elementType is "text field" then
                    set foundElement to text field elementName of group 1 of group 1 of window 1
                end if
                
                -- Add to cache
                set end of elementCache to {cacheKey, foundElement}
                
                return foundElement
                
            on error
                return missing value
            end try
        end tell
    end tell
end getElement

on clearElementCache()
    set elementCache to {}
end clearElementCache
```

### Batch Operations

```applescript
-- Process multiple actions efficiently
on batchNavigationActions(actionList)
    tell application "Simulator" to activate
    delay 2
    
    tell application "System Events"
        tell process "Simulator"
            repeat with action in actionList
                set actionType to item 1 of action
                set actionTarget to item 2 of action
                set actionDelay to item 3 of action
                
                try
                    if actionType is "click" then
                        click button actionTarget of group 1 of group 1 of window 1
                    else if actionType is "type" then
                        keystroke actionTarget
                    else if actionType is "key" then
                        key code actionTarget
                    end if
                    
                    delay actionDelay
                    
                on error errMsg
                    log "Batch action failed: " & actionType & " " & actionTarget & " - " & errMsg
                end try
            end repeat
        end tell
    end tell
end batchNavigationActions

-- Example usage
set actions to {{"click", "Settings", 2}, {"click", "Export Data", 3}, {"click", "Cancel", 1}}
batchNavigationActions(actions)
```

## Conclusion

This guide provides a comprehensive foundation for using AppleScript to navigate iOS apps in the simulator. While XCUIAutomation remains the preferred method for formal testing, AppleScript offers valuable capabilities for manual exploration, documentation, and ad-hoc automation tasks.

### Key Takeaways

1. **Always activate the Simulator** before attempting UI interactions
2. **Use proper delays** to account for UI transitions and animations
3. **Implement robust error handling** with fallback strategies
4. **Validate elements** before attempting to interact with them
5. **Document your findings** for future reference and debugging
6. **Combine with screenshot capture** for comprehensive UI documentation

### Next Steps

- Practice with simple apps before tackling complex interfaces
- Combine AppleScript automation with XCUIAutomation for comprehensive testing
- Create reusable functions and libraries for common interaction patterns
- Consider integrating with CI/CD pipelines for automated documentation generation

Remember that UI structures can change between app versions, so always test your scripts thoroughly and implement flexible element discovery strategies.
