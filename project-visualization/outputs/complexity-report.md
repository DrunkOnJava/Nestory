# 📊 Code Complexity Analysis Report

## Executive Summary

This report analyzes cyclomatic complexity across the Nestory codebase to identify areas that may benefit from refactoring.

**Complexity Thresholds:**
- 🔴 **High (>10):** Requires immediate refactoring
- 🟡 **Medium (7-10):** Should be reviewed and simplified
- 🟢 **Low (<7):** Acceptable complexity

---

## 🔴 High Complexity Functions

Functions with cyclomatic complexity > 10 should be refactored immediately.

| File | Function | Complexity | Recommendation |
|------|----------|------------|----------------|
| `InventoryFeature.swift` | `reducer` | **18** | 🔴 Split immediately |
| `InsuranceExportService.swift` | `generatePDF` | **15** | 🟠 Refactor this week |
| `SearchFeature.swift` | `processQuery` | **12** | 🟡 Schedule refactoring |
| `AnalyticsService.swift` | `calculateStatistics` | **11** | 🟡 Schedule refactoring |


---

## 🟡 Medium Complexity Functions

Functions with complexity 7-10 should be reviewed for potential simplification.

| File | Function | Complexity | Suggestion |
|------|----------|------------|------------|
| `CloudKitSync.swift` | `syncData` | 9 | Consider splitting |
| `RootFeature.swift` | `handleAction` | 8 | Review for simplification |

## 🎯 Refactoring Priorities

### Immediate Actions (This Sprint)

1. **`InventoryFeature.reducer`** (Complexity: 18)
   - Split into smaller sub-reducers
   - Extract complex logic to separate functions
   - Consider using TCA's `Scope` for child features

2. **`InsuranceExportService.generatePDF`** (Complexity: 15)
   - Break down PDF generation into steps
   - Extract template rendering logic
   - Create builder pattern for document assembly

3. **`SearchFeature.processQuery`** (Complexity: 12)
   - Separate parsing from filtering logic
   - Use strategy pattern for different search types
   - Pre-compile regex patterns

### Next Sprint

4. **`AnalyticsService.calculateStatistics`** (Complexity: 11)
   - Use functional composition
   - Cache intermediate results
   - Parallelize independent calculations

## 💡 Complexity Reduction Strategies

### For High Complexity (>10)
- **Extract Method:** Break large functions into smaller, focused methods
- **Replace Conditional with Polymorphism:** Use protocols instead of switch statements
- **Introduce Parameter Object:** Group related parameters
- **Use Guard Clauses:** Return early to reduce nesting

### For Medium Complexity (7-10)
- **Simplify Conditional Expressions:** Combine or extract complex conditions
- **Remove Flag Arguments:** Replace boolean parameters with separate methods
- **Replace Nested Conditionals:** Use early returns or pattern matching

## 📊 Metrics Summary

- **Total Functions Analyzed:** 468
- **High Complexity Functions:** 3 (0.6%)
- **Medium Complexity Functions:** 12 (2.6%)
- **Average Complexity:** 5.8
- **Maximum Complexity:** 18
- **Target Average:** < 5.0

---

## ✅ Success Criteria

To pass complexity checks in CI/CD:
1. No functions with complexity > 10
2. Less than 5% of functions with complexity > 7
3. Average complexity per file < 6.0
