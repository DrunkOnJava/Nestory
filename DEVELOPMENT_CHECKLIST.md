# Development Checklist - ALWAYS WIRE UP YOUR FEATURES!

## 🚨 CRITICAL REMINDER

**The #1 mistake in this project: Creating features that users can't access!**

Example: Receipt OCR was fully implemented but had no UI access point initially.

## ✅ Feature Implementation Checklist

For EVERY new feature, complete ALL steps:

### 1. Planning Phase
- [ ] Identify what the feature does
- [ ] Determine WHERE users will access it from
- [ ] Plan the navigation flow

### 2. Implementation Phase
- [ ] Create the service/business logic
- [ ] Create the UI view/component
- [ ] Add necessary model properties

### 3. 🔌 WIRING PHASE (CRITICAL!)
- [ ] Add @State variable for presentation
- [ ] Add button/trigger in parent view
- [ ] Add sheet/navigation/tab presentation
- [ ] Verify feature is accessible

### 4. Testing Phase
- [ ] Build successfully
- [ ] Test in simulator
- [ ] Verify user can reach the feature
- [ ] Test the complete flow

## 📍 Where to Wire Features

### ItemDetailView
Wire here for item-specific features:
- ✅ Edit Item (sheet)
- ✅ Receipt OCR (sheet)
- Future: Warranty info, documents, videos

### SettingsView
Wire here for app utilities:
- ✅ Import/Export (sheet + fileImporter)
- ✅ Insurance Reports (sheet)
- Future: Backup, account settings

### ContentView (TabView)
Wire here for major features:
- ✅ Inventory (tab)
- ✅ Search (tab)
- ✅ Analytics (tab)
- ✅ Categories (tab)
- ✅ Settings (tab)

### SearchView
Wire here for search enhancements:
- ✅ Smart filters
- ✅ Special search syntax
- Future: Saved searches

## 🔴 Red Flags - Stop if you see these!

1. **Created a service but no UI uses it**
   - Stop! Wire it up immediately

2. **Created a view but no navigation to it**
   - Stop! Add button/link to access it

3. **Added a feature but user can't find it**
   - Stop! Make it discoverable

4. **Implemented logic but no way to trigger it**
   - Stop! Add user interaction

## 📝 Example: Proper Feature Wiring

### ❌ WRONG - Feature exists but not accessible:
```swift
// Created ReceiptOCRService.swift ✓
// Created ReceiptCaptureView.swift ✓
// But... how does user access it? 🤷‍♂️
```

### ✅ RIGHT - Feature is wired up:
```swift
// In ItemDetailView.swift:
@State private var showingReceiptCapture = false  // 1. State

GroupBox("Receipt Documentation") {
    Button("Add Receipt") {                       // 2. Trigger
        showingReceiptCapture = true
    }
}

.sheet(isPresented: $showingReceiptCapture) {     // 3. Presentation
    ReceiptCaptureView(item: item)
}
```

## 🎯 Quick Wire-Up Templates

### For Sheet Presentation:
```swift
@State private var showingFeatureName = false

Button("Feature Name") {
    showingFeatureName = true
}

.sheet(isPresented: $showingFeatureName) {
    FeatureView()
}
```

### For Navigation Link:
```swift
NavigationLink(destination: FeatureView()) {
    Label("Feature Name", systemImage: "icon.name")
}
```

### For Tab:
```swift
// In ContentView TabView:
FeatureView()
    .tabItem {
        Label("Feature", systemImage: "icon")
    }
```

## 🔄 Post-Implementation Verification

After implementing any feature, verify:

1. **Can a new user find it?**
   - Is there a visible button/link?
   - Is it in a logical location?

2. **Is the navigation clear?**
   - Can user get there in 3 taps or less?
   - Is there a back/cancel option?

3. **Does it work end-to-end?**
   - Start from home screen
   - Navigate to feature
   - Use feature
   - Return successfully

## 💡 Remember

**"If a feature exists but users can't access it, it doesn't exist!"**

Always ask yourself:
- WHERE will users access this?
- HOW will they find it?
- WHAT triggers it?

If you can't answer these, STOP and wire it up properly!
